#####
# Get Python
#####
# decide what version you need from: https://www.python.org/downloads/source/
# after clicking on the version link, download as source code (Gzipped source tarball)
#   for 2.7.13: https://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.7.13/Python-2.7.13.tgz
#   for 3.6.1: https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.6.1/Python-3.6.1.tgz
# the following will show steps for 2.7.13
# unarchive/decompress the tarball
    tar zxvf Python-2.7.13.tgz
#go into the Python-2.7.13/ directory
    cd Python-2.7.13/

#####
# Install Python
#####
# configure & install with specified directory for installation
    ./configure --prefix=YOURPYTHONPATH #where YOURPYTHONPATH is the directory where you want the python bin, lib, etc to exist
    make
    make install

#####
# Create environment script
#####
# Create an environment script (I make a $HOME/python-2.7.13_env) to direct your PYTHONPATH & PATH (or include in your .bashrc or .bash_profile)
    export PATH="./:YOURPYTHONPATH/bin/:${PATH}" #for your system's executables
    export PYTHONPATH="./:YOURPYTHONPATH"
#source your new script so that you can make use of the python version you just installed
    source $HOME/python-2.7.13_env
#make sure you have pip. You should see pip among the executables, if not, we'll address that next.
    ll PYTHONPATH/bin/
#if no pip there, get it, but first you'll need setuptools
    PYTHONPATH/bin/python -m ensurepip
#then get the pip tarball from: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip/
#decompress/unarchive with (assuming for python 2.7, and latest (at this time) pip)
    tar zxvf pip-9.0.1.tar.gz
#go into the new pip directory
    cd pip-9.0.1/
#install with 
    python setup.py install --prefix=YOURPYTHONPATH
    python setup.py install --prefix PYTHONPATH
#now you can install with this new pip when using the appropriate environment variables
    
#####
# Install what you want
#####
# now that you've installed python, sourced the environment, installed setuptools & pip, you can install what you want like this
    pip install X --prefix=YOURPYTHONPATH #where X is . for a local project with a setup.py or something pacakage from PyPI
    
#####
# Install to $HOME/.local
#####
# you have the option to install packages with the --user flag. This will install packages to $HOME/.local/.
    pip install X --user
# to make use of these new installs, you'll need to add $HOME/.local/bin to PATH & $HOME/.local/ to your PTYHONPATH environment variables
