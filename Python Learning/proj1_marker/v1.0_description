To make the program more extendable. We need to make it more modulized.

Module:

gramma analyser:  read text, manage other texts

rules: define rules for every type of blocks. detect each type of block and apply rule on it.

filtre: need to deal with some inline element

handler: gramma analyser can use handler to output . each handler can create different types of tag.
