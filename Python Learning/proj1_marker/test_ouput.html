A short history of the company
</h1>
World Wide Spam was started in the summer of 2000. The business concept was to ride the dot-com wave and to make money both though bulk mail and by selling canned meat online.
</p>
After receiving serveral comlaints from custumers who weren't satisfied by their bulk mail. World Wide Spam altered their profile, and focused 100% on canned goods. Today , they rak as the world's 13,892nd online supplier of SPAM.
